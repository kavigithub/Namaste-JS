async and await does not bring any new progremming concept. They are two new key words.

with the help of aysnc and await we can easyly use Promise

async : return a promise...we need to use for function...for aysnc call
await : to wait and handle a promise

async function

//you can not use await on non async function

Async means asynchronous. It allows a program to run a function without freezing the entire program. This is done using the Async/Await keyword.

Async/Await makes it easier to write promises. The keyword ‘async’ before a function makes the function return a promise, always. And the keyword await is used inside async functions, which makes the program wait until the Promise resolves.
