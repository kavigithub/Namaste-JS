  <p>{} this is block. it is also know as compound/Combined statement. A block is combined multiple javascript statement into one group</p>
  <p><code>
    //combined statement
    //we grouped multiple statement together in a block {}... so that we can use it...where JS can expects one statement
    eg: if(true) (will give u an error syntax as it expects statement)
    like this if(true) true...this is valid One JS statement but if you want to create multiple statmement then you need to group it in a block {}

   if(true) {
    //multiple statments
    var a = 10; //global scope... ...they stored in global scope... u can access
    let b = 20; //block scope ...they stored in block scope...u can't not access out of this block
    const c = 30; //block scope  ...they stored in block scope......u can't not access out of this block
    console.log(a)
   }

   basically you can access the variable(which is defined by let&const) inside that{} block scope eg let and const...but var is global scope

   Scope :- scope of a variable or a function is the place where these are accessible.
Block scope :-  The variables and function present within the scope of a block section. And block follows the lexical scope chain pattern while accessing the variable.

   what is shadowing?
   Providing same name to the variable as of those variable which are present in outer scope.
   let b = 100
   {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(b) ///20 in block scope it has different memory same happens with const
   }
   console.log(b) ///100 in global scope it will change

   const c = 100;
   function scope(){
    const c = 30
    console.log(c);
   }
   console.log(c); //100
   scope(); //30

   5. The shadow should not cross the scope of original otherwise it will give error.
   6. shadowing let with var is illegal shadowing and gives error.
